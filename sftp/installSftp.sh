#
#   sFTP is a â€œsecure version of file transfer protocol which helps
#   in transmitting data over a secure shell data stream, it is simply a secure way of transferring
#   files between local and remote servers.
#
#   This function helps to automate the creation of sftp user group, this way, we can restrict
#   this group to each user document root e.g /var/www/website1
#

  #
  #   The goal of this function is not to create an sftp access arbitrarily, but to
  #   to jail a user, this way they have no way to break out of their home directory.
  #
  #   We then mount a location to their home directory, so they can upload files to their website root folder.
  #   For example, If user "paul" needs to upload files to /var/www/websitename.com, we chroot to /home/jail/paul
  #   and then mount /var/www/websitename.com to their home directory, this way, they can upload to the correct website directory without
  #   needing access to it, and thus, things would be breeze and secure.
